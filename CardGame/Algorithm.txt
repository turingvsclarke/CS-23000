Ryan Eades

Output:
The project will output all the cards in a normal 52 card deck. It will print a numbered list of the cards
and assign five cards each to the computer and to the player. It will also print the
a list of the five cards assigned to each player.

Input:
This program receives no input.

Steps:

1. Create a main function that looks exactly like Andy's.
2. Define a clear deck function.
	a. This function makes the list of cards all zeroes.
3. Define a function that assigns cards to each "player"
4. Define a showdeck function that shows all the cards.
5. Define a showdeck function that shows all the cards in a players hand.
