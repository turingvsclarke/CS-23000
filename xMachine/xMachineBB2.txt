;;Divider: put in any two positive integers and a quotient and remainder are 
;;respectively put in the first two addresses. First number is dividend
;;and second is divisor. Division by zero makes the computer
;;run forever, a fitting consequence for someone who tried to divide by zero

div1:20
div2:3
remainder:0
quotient:0

;;Take the dividend and subtract off the divisor until its negative

begin: LOD div1
	SUB div2
	STO div1
	JMN finish
	LOD quotient
	INC quotient
	STO quotient
	JMP begin

;;Add the divisor back and store this value as a remainder

finish:ADD div2
	STO remainder
    quit

quit:LOD quotient
	STO 0
	LOD remainder
	STO 1
	HLT
