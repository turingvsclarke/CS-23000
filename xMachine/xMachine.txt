;;A basic multiplier that can multiply two positive, nonzero integers.

;; Add counter to itself.
begin1:LOD product	
    ADD counter
	STO product
;; Each time counter is added to itself, it decreases a value.
begin3:LOD cntDn
    DEC
	STO cntDn
;;When counter is added to itself cntDn times it stops,
;;otherwise it adds the counter to itself again.
    JMZ quit
	JMP begin1

quit:HLT

;; Numbers to be multiplied are cntDn and counter, result stored in product.
cntDn:10
product:0
counter:6
