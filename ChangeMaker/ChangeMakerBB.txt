Blackbelt ChangeMaker Algorithm
Ryan Eades

Goals:
Create a vending machine that has a list of products and corresponding prices and
allows a user to buy as many products as they want. It will then print off a receipt and verbalize returning correct change.

Input: 
The user will provide the number corresponding to each entry they want and be able to "checkout" once they're done shopping. 
They will also need to "pay" by entering dollar amounts.

Output:
The program will have two major outputs. First, it will print a numbered list of all of the products and their prices. 
It will tell the user how much the total is. Once the user has paid, it will print a "receipt", including the products purchased 
and their prices, the total for the order, the dollar amount paid, and the change back, including the exact quantity of each denomination.

Steps:
Create a list of all the products and another list of prices in which the nth product corresponds to the nth price. 
Print a numbered list of these products and their prices. Prompt the user to enter as many products as they want. 
Check to make sure that this input corresponds to one of the products and if it does, store the products in a list of selections. 
Allow the user to quit the selection process when they type "finish". For each entry in the selection list, add its price to a running total. 
Tell the user this total and prompt them to type a dollar amount. Ask the user for more money if they didn't pay enough. 
Print out all the items they purchased, with text justification corresponding to normal receipt formatting. 
Print out the cash tendered and the total for the order. 
Finally, run the change-making process as in the base assignment, using the total and paid amounts to deduce the total change and the quantity 
of each dollar denomination (pennies through hundred dollar bills) to be returned to the user. Print out these results.
