High Low Algorithm
Ryan Eades

Goals:
The goal is to create an interactive game for the user. The computer begins by 
generating a random integer between 1 and 100. The user guesses a number and the 
computer indicates whether that guess it too high, too low, or correct. This continues
until the user guesses the correct number.

Input:
The user will be prompted to input integer numbers until the number they input matches
a random number generated by the computer.

Output:
The program will indicate whether each successive guess is larger or smaller than the
number generated by the computer. It will let the user know when they have guessed the
correct number.

Steps:
We first store a secret number that is a random integer generated using the random module. 
We will then prompt the user to input a number between 1 and 100. The program will transition to
a loop that runs as long as the guessed number and the randomly generated number have the same
value. Within these loops, there will be two conditions depending on whether or not the guess is
larger or smaller than the generated value. In either case, the program will output the relationship
between their guess and the stored value. It will prompt them to input another number and run through
the loop again with this new input. Once the user has guessed the correct number, the program will alert them of this and end.
